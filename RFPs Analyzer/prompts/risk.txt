   - Integration challenges
   - Resource availability
   - Technical capability gaps
   - Performance requirements risks

2. Business Risks:
   - Contract value vs. company capacity
   - Resource allocation conflicts

   - Strategic alignment
   - Growth/scaling requirements

3. Financial Risks:
   - Project profitability
   - Cash flow requirements
   - Payment terms impact
   - Currency/market fluctuations

5. Compliance Risks:

   - Certification maintenance
   - Data security requirements
   - Environmental compliance

For each identified risk:
1. Risk Description
2. Probability (Low/Medium/High)
3. Impact (Low/Medium/High)
4. Risk Score (1-25)
5. Mitigation Strategies
6. Contingency Plans

- Overall Risk Assessment Score
- Recommended Risk Mitigation Strategies
- Go/No-Go Recommendation based on Risk Profile

Consider both:
- Direct risks from RFP requirements
