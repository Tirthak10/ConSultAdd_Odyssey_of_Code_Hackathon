# ConSultAdd_Odyssey_of_Code_Hackathon
RFP-AI is a Gen AI-powered solution developed during the ConsultAdd Hackathon to automate the analysis of government Requests for Proposals (RFPs). Responding to RFPs is a time-sensitive, compliance-heavy processâ€”and we aim to simplify it using Generative AI, Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG), and agentic workflows.
